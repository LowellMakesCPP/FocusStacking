# Protocol for communication between FocusStacking ImageServer and clients


Reference: [TCP/IP Protocol Design: Message Framing, by **Stephen Cleary**, 25 Jun 2009](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37496/TCP-IP-Protocol-Design-Message-Framing)

1. Messages are encoded in ASCII, binary data are encoded in hex within a message.
2. Each message unit starts with a M followed by a four character message code (case sensitive), followed by data that depends on the message.
3. Each message ends with the character Z (case sensitive) followed by a new-line character.
4. Data can never contain the characters upper-case M or upper-case Z.
5. Messages are at most 10240 bytes (= 10 KB) in length. Longer data transfers are split into multiple segments.
6. The same message id can be used for the query or request and reply from server.

The following messages are defined:

1. **MGTID**: get stack id. Sent from client to server to request for a new stack id. There is no data associated with this message. Thus a full message would look like: "_MGTIDZ\n_".
2. **MGTID**: Server returns newly assigned stack id to client. A stack id is a [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) generated by the server that is guaranteed to be unique for a given database. The data consists of 32 lower-case hexadecimal digits. Thus a full message could look like: "_MGTID123e4567e89b12d3a456426655440000Z\n_".
3. **MPING**: ping server. Client requests server for identification. Server returns version and database information. "_MPINGZ\n_" "_MPING FocusStacking ImageServer version 0.1 database: _"
4. **MLIST**: list database. Client requests server for list of stacks stored in the database. Server returns
