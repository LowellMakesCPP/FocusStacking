## Components
### ImageServer

An `ImageServer` is a standalone executable server that that we plan to compile and test for at least three different platforms:

1. Linux 32/64 bit
2. Windows 32/64 bit
3. Raspberry Pi 2

The program has a command line and file log output and a settings file. Ideally, it will only use the standard C++ and boost libraries. However, if additional libraries required, we will cautiously add them.
